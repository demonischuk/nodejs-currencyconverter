# Simple NodeJs Console App Currency Converter
Simple NodeJs console app for converting GBP into other currencies

Make it available to execute anywhere by typing `npm link` in the root directory
You can then type `currency` to execute the application

## Future plans
* Take in parameters, e.g. so you could run `currency EUR 55.60`
* Handle the Api being down
* Unit tests
